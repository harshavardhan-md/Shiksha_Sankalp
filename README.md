## 🌈 Introduction

**Shiksha Sankalp** is more than a platform—it's a **commitment to education equity** powered by community voices. We bridge the gap between women's collectives driving educational change and the resources they need to amplify their impact.

Developed as part of the **Innovation 4 Education Equity Hackathon** by Shiksha Lokam under the **Shikshagraha** movement, we're contributing to the mission of uplifting 1 million public schools by 2030.

## 💫 What Sets Us Apart

Our innovation extends beyond traditional education platforms:

### 🗣️ Grassroots-First Approach
Unlike top-down education platforms, we center the voices of women's collectives working directly in villages. Their knowledge, challenges, and solutions drive our data collection and insights.

### 🧠 Cross-Regional Learning
Our platform enables knowledge sharing across geographic boundaries, allowing successful interventions from one region to inspire solutions in another.

### 🔄 Closing the Feedback Loop
By connecting policymakers with ground realities, we ensure that educational policies are informed by actual classroom experiences and community needs.
